# Password-Generator

### Goal

The main goal of the application is to generate random passwords with at least 8, and up to 128 characters, that contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters.

To do so we needed code to:

-confirm with user to ask whether or not they want certain character types and store the data
-prompt user to select how many characters they wanted their password to be, have error messages if they selected anything outside of 8-128, and store the answer
-Start the process over for the user if they did not select at least one character type.
-Loop through their inputs and randomly select characters based on their answers to generate a new password, and display it to the user.


### Struggles

I really only struggled with the process of actually picking out the random characters and generating the password once all information was collected and stored. I also was a little unsure on how to handle it if someone didn't select a character option

### Screenshots

Here is a screenshot for what it looks like when you open the page:
